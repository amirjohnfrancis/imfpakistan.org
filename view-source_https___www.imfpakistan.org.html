        <p align="center">Welcome to Iqbal Masih Foundation, where every donation makes a difference</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>Iqbal Masih Backround:</strong></p>
        <p>Iqbal Masih was born in1983 - 16 April 1995 in Muridka,  of Lahore in Pakistan.
Pakistan,  received The World's Children's Honorary Award 2000 posthumously, for his  struggle for the rights of debt slave children. Iqbal became a debt slave at an  early age, for the owner of a carpet factory who then sold him on.
Iqbal  was around 5 or 6 when he started working in the carpet factory. He worked from  early morning until evening and was often treated badly. When his mother Anayat  needs money for an operation, she took out a loan from a carpet factory owner.  The loan, or ‘peshgi’, was in Iqbal’s name. That means that Iqbal owes Ghullah  the 5000 rupees (100 US dollars) that his mother’s operation cost. Now Iqbal  was a debt slave and the factory owner was in charge of his life.
Five  years later, Iqbal was liberated from debt slavery. He started attending the  Bonded Labour Liberation Front (BLLF) School. Iqbal talked to his friends who  worked at carpet factories and spoke at meetings. He gave many carpet worker  children the courage to leave their owners. The owners threatened Iqbal who,  after receiving an award in the USA, was murdered on 16 April 1995.</p>
